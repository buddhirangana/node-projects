# Node Projects

- Before starting to implement the `Node Projects`, we need to set up the required environment for the project. Below sections will guide you to set up the environment. If you have already installed them, you can skip the relevant sections.

## Installing Node.js

Check whether `Node.js` and `npm package manager` is already installed by typing the following commands in the command line.
```bash
# Check the Node.js version
node -v

# Check the npm version
npm -v
```
> **Important**: This project requires a Node.js version of 14 or higher.

If the above is not installed, download suitable `Node.js` package for your OS using the following [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it.

## Installing Dependencies

After completing the above installations, we must install the dependencies specified in the `package.json` files for the projects.

- To install the dependencies of the backend, type the following command from the root of the project.
```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install
```
